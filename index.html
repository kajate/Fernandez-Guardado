			She studied at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands and Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain,
			from where she graduated in 2010.
			<br><br>
			In 2012 she moved to Berlin, and started to work for <a href="https://june-14.com" target="blank">June14 Meyer-Grohbrügge & Chermayeff</a> and
			<a href="https://samchermayeffoffice.com" target="blank">Sam Chermayeff Office</a>
			as a head designer for 6 years. During this period, while working in many different scale projects from landscape to furniture,
			she led the design of the building group housing project in Kurfurstenstrasse 142-143 in Berlin, which is currently under construction
			and which design consultancy she still manages.
			<br><br>
			In 2017 she co-founded the furniture design studio <a href="http://www.prettysomething.de">PRETTY SOMETHING</a>
			with Diogo Passarinho and joined the Technical University of Berlin as a researcher and teaching assistant.
			<br><br>
			In 2018 Marta enrolled in the the practice-based doctoral program <a href="http://www.pep.tu-berlin.de">PEP</a>
			and started an exploration of the domestic environment and alternative ways of living, working on architectural body scale artefacts.

			<p>The architectural construction is obviously a necessary requirement to create space, but it is not
				sufficient. Unlike territory, architecture needs relate to people in order to be complete; it needs
				to be inhabited. This binding process depends on the identification offered by the architecture
				and the actions and transformations that the inhabitants perform in it.</p>

			<p>The phenomenon intensifies in housing architecture, which crisis in Europe still continues.
				Costs rise faster than incomes, particularly in major cities. Construction recovers slower than
				prices and shortage drives them up even more. Due to economical speculation, housing has
				become an investment objective economically “in use" even when houses are unoccupied. The						market remains conservative and the housing model hardly evolves, identifying fewer and fewer
				people. Labour mobility, leisure long-term displacements and other migration flows are
				transferring our homes to not permanent and not owned, new platforms. Meaningful actions in
				the domestic space are discarded, especially among young renters. Objects (own, borrowed or
				shared) and ceremonies (daily, as a host or as a guest) become indispensable mechanisms to
				relate ourselves to the place we live in, and consequently part of the architecture.</p>

			<p>Home is no more one and forever, but remains a place for protection, and even for presentation,
				reproduction and production. Its floor plan still represents a fragmented domesticity with specific
				rooms for every action, but not every action is always the same nor happens at the same time.
				Its furniture and equipment are used to program spaces, but not to program lives, which are
				constantly changing. The bed, for instance, traditionally one of the most intimate domestic
				inventions, is overtaking the sofa as the most used item of furniture and even becoming a
				regular working place.</p>

			<p>The big and small architectural traditions that shape our lives are just assumptions that can be
				observed, questioned and redesigned. Meanwhile, in this context of crisis, mostly understood in
				economically terms, the capacity of radical exploration of architecture seems limited. Can the
				architect propose alternative explorations to the building? Can the architectural thinking apply to
				other scales and times? If space is created from the body, are there other active architectural
				bodies that may be used to relate people to foreign architectures, and even to other people and
				themselves? Can architectural ideas be tested through those bodies and be potentially applied
				to the architecture afterwards? Could they integrate emerging alternative domestic practises out
				of the dichotomy public/private, which architecture has not yet reached?
				The study proposes an object-based design investigation of the domestic environment as an
				architecture where things and bodies cohabit, in order to explore the architectural statement for
				contemporary ways of living.</p>
